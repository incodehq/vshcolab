This application is an exploration of a "workflow" domain for http://www.hagerbach.ch/[VSH VersuchsStollen Hagerbach], part of the link:Amberg Group[http://www.amberg.ch/].

The software was developed by link:http://incode.org/[Incode Software] in partnership with Colab, and uses link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] as its underlying platform.

== Screenshots

=== Login & Home page

The application is secured by a login page:

image::{_imagesdir}/010-login.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/010-login.png"]

The mechanism to store user authentication credentials is pluggable, as is the authorisation mechanism; many in the Apache Isis community use the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module.
For demonstration purposes the user/password is `sven`/`pass`.

The first page shown is the home page.
This can be configured to act as a dashboard of the most commonly used information, customized for the end-user if required.
For this exploration app it just lists all current clients, their sites, and any current projects:

image::{_imagesdir}/020-home-page.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/020-home-page.png"]

The exploration identified `Project` as a domain concept but did not flesh it out further.

=== Clients

The starting point for the exploration is the `Client` entity.
Each entity has a name and a list of ``Site``s of that entity:

image::{_imagesdir}/030-client.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/030-client.png"]

To update the client's name, click on the pencil icon for the field.
This results in a dialog:

image::{_imagesdir}/040-edit-name.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/040-edit-name.png"]

Completing the dialog will update the client's name.



=== Client Sites

Clients also have associated sites.
These can be shown as a table:

image::{_imagesdir}/050-view-sites-on-map.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/050-view-sites-on-map.png"]

or in map form:

image::{_imagesdir}/060-client-sites.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/060-client-sites.png"]

[NOTE]
====
There is a possible technical glitch meaning that rendering sites on maps currently isn't working reliably.
====

From the map or table, we can drill down to the site details.

image::{_imagesdir}/070-client-site.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/070-client-site.png"]

As modelled in the exploration, a site is little more than a container for the client's orders.
The modelling in this part of the exploration is, we believe incorrect: instead it is the client that should hae the list of orders, rather than the client's site.
Then, each client's order may optionally be associated with a site (or perhaps sites) where the tests are to be performed.

The Apache Isis UI allows each object's properties/collections to be grouped in tabs; this lets less important/less frequently updated information be moved to a less distracting place.
The layout of the UI is also very quick to update, so the developer can easily adjust the UI according to the wishes of the end-user.
In the future, we hope to allow the layout to be updated by the end-user themselves as the application runs.

For a client site, the address and GPS location can be updated:

image::{_imagesdir}/080-update-location.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/080-update-location.png"]

We use Google's geolocation service to decode the text into a precise location:

image::{_imagesdir}/090-location-as-text-or-gps.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/090-location-as-text-or-gps.png"]

As well as viewing the sites for one client, all client sites can be shown:

image::{_imagesdir}/100-view-sites.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/100-view-sites.png"]

(For the exploration, only sites of one client were added):

image::{_imagesdir}/110-sites-updated.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/110-sites-updated.png"]


=== Orders

From the client's site object, the list of orders can be accessed.
As noted above, this list of orders should instead probably be available from the client object itself.
It would also be possible to provide an action on the top-level menu bar to look up a client order directly:

image::{_imagesdir}/120-client-orders.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/120-client-orders.png"]

The order in turn has a list of tests.
Each test is in effect a "line-item" of the order.
The exploration lists these in a calendar view:

image::{_imagesdir}/130-planned-tests-on-calendar.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/130-planned-tests-on-calendar.png"]

Again, the modelling here is probably wrong.
Instead, we think that while the order does indeed capture the test procedures that the customer has purchased to be performed, instead it is the project object (shown only on the home page, above) that would be used to schedule and execute those tests, possibly on behalf of several orders for several different clients.

In other words, while the order represents which tests the client needs to be executed, the project is the internal mechanism through which VSH actually executes those tests.


=== Test "executions" (Durchfuehrung)

The order's tests can also be shown in table form:

image::{_imagesdir}/140-tests-in-table-form.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/140-tests-in-table-form.png"]

From which we can drill down into the test "execution" itself:

image::{_imagesdir}/150-test-execution-links-to-test-procedure.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/150-test-execution-links-to-test-procedure.png"]

Initially the test hasn't been executed ("when" and "who" are not populated), so this really represents a planned test.

The "warten (Tage)" is a constraint indicating how long to wait from order/project commencement before this test can be performed.
In a fuller exploration, there would doubtless be other types of constraints.

The test execution also references to the test procedure.


=== Test procedures (PruefVerfahren)

A test procedure describes "what" the test is; it is these that are in the listed in the library/catalog of tests (VSH Baustoff-Prueflabore Preisliste):

image::{_imagesdir}/160-test-procedure.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/160-test-procedure.png"]

Each test procedure identifies the norms that it captures, along with its price.

Tests procedures can also be organized hierarchically, hence any given test procedure may have a number of children.
Equally, they may therefore also have a parent test procedure.

One area discussed but not fully developed was the concept of work instructions.
If the test procedure is the "what", then a work instruction constitute the "how".
In the context of a project which organises a number of test executions, the work instructions could for example be pulled together to provide detailed guidance on a day-by-day basis.


=== Measurements

Back on the test object, the "execute" action allows the end-user to indicates that the test is now to be performed:

image::{_imagesdir}/170-execute-test.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/170-execute-test.png"]

The salient details captured is the when and the who; these are both defaulted automatically but can be overridden.

image::{_imagesdir}/180-capture-who-and-when.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/180-capture-who-and-when.png"]

Once this information is known, then the list of measurements becomes visible and new measurement(s) be added:

image::{_imagesdir}/190-add-measurements.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/190-add-measurements.png"]

The measurement allows the norm being measured (as defined by the associated test procedure) to be specified:

image::{_imagesdir}/200-specify-norm-being-measured.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/200-specify-norm-being-measured.png"]

It also allows the actual value, along with the time that it was made:

image::{_imagesdir}/210-when-and-value.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/210-when-and-value.png"]

The measurement is then added to the list; multiple measurements can if necessary be taken:

image::{_imagesdir}/220-measurement-added.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/220-measurement-added.png"]

Note that the exploration application only works at a very fine-grained level; it would be tedious to enter every individual measurement in this easy.
Also, for some test procedures (such as an FBK) are composite; they are which are purchased as a single item but correspond to multiple tests to be executed.

It would therefore probably make sense to develop a dedicated UI for this use case, probably also to run on a tablet so that measurements can be taken directly on-site.
Such measurements could then be uploaded once back online.

=== Test procedures (revisited)

As noted above, test procedures can be grouped together (that is, are composite).
All can be viewed using a top-level menu:

image::{_imagesdir}/230-view-test-procedures.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/230-view-test-procedures.png"]

Resulting in:

image::{_imagesdir}/240-test-procedures.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/240-test-procedures.png"]

Any of these individual test procedures can be viewed:

image::{_imagesdir}/250-child-procedures.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/250-child-procedures.png"]

This information is read-only for most end-users, though administrators would be able to update it.
Also, while the exploration combines the test procedure and cost information, in a fully developed application these would probably be separated out.

The exploration also supports the concept of capturing other non-test procedures, such as setting up a project definition:

image::{_imagesdir}/260-other-procedures.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/260-other-procedures.png"]

Just like regular test procedures, these other procedures could have their own corresponding work instructions.


=== Custom UIs

The generic UI displayed above is suitable for back-office staff performing general adminstration, but is not appropriate for high volume or specialized tasks (such as taking test measurements).
As noted above, for such tasks a custom UI is more appropriate.

To support the development of such custom UIs, Apache Isis automatically provides a "RESTful" API, designed to be invoked and consumed by the custom UI.
A link:http://swagger.io/[swagger] UI makes this accessible to the software developer writing the custom UI.

image::{_imagesdir}/270-swagger.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/270-swagger.png"]

Using this tool, the developer can interact with any of the domain objects, for example obtaining the current state of a test "execution" (Durchfuehrung):

image::{_imagesdir}/280-swagger-2.png[width="833px",height="521px", link="{_imagesdir}/280-swagger-2.png"]

== Application Structure

The following table explains the contents of each of the directories:

[width="100%",options="header,footer", cols="2a,4a"]
|====================
|Directory
|Description

|`application`
|Defines application-level classes such as menus and the ``AppManifest`` (which defines the modules that make up the application).
It also  holds application-wide integration tests/BDD specs.

|`module-work`
|Holds the "work" module, consisting of all of the entities/services/business logic that comprise the exploration.
Also runs `isis:validate` goal for the domain objects within the module. +

[TIP]
====
Larger applications should consist of multiple modules; each such module can be copied from this starter module.
====

|`webapp`
|Assembles the application into a webapp (comprising both the Wicket viewer and Restful Objects viewer) and runs the `isis:swagger` goal.

|`_checks`
|Checkstyle and PMD rule sets for static analysis.

[TIP]
====
Extend/adapt these according to your own standards.
====


|====================


== Deployed

The latest build of the application is deployed to the Microsoft Azure cloud:

http://vshcolab.azurewebsites.net/vshcolab/wicket

It's running on a low-cost plan with limited memory and the application goes into hibernate mode when inactive so it can take a while before the application responds when it needs to start up again.
This is for demo purposes only, don't expect the same responsiveness a you would in a production environment.
